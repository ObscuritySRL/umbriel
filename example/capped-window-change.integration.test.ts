/**
 * capped-window-change — the post-action / re-ground snapshot compared the CAPPED rendered body (renderTree →
 * capSnapshot at SNAPSHOT_MAX_CHARS) for byte-equality, so on a heavy window an action that changed something BELOW the
 * cap produced a byte-identical capped body and was reported as "no UI change — refs unchanged" — a silent false
 * negative on exactly the big windows the cap exists to protect. withSnapshot now skips the byte-equality short-circuit
 * when the body is truncated and lets the FULL-tree diff (uncapped) decide; snapshotText re-dumps a truncated explicit
 * re-ground. Both gate on the capSnapshot truncation trailer.
 *
 * Proof (unit + static — no FFI, the fix is pure control-flow): capSnapshot emits the exact "…(N more nodes — narrow
 * with …" trailer ONLY when it truncates, and both short-circuit sites in mcp.ts are gated on that marker. So a
 * byte-identical CAPPED body is never reported as "no UI change". (A live below-cap-change 2nd-op assertion needs a
 * second MCP walk of a heavy window, which hangs cross-process on this Bun build — the reveal-offscreen FFI-at-scale
 * class — so it is not exercised here; the guard is proven against the marker its producer emits.)
 *
 * bun test is broken repo-wide — runnable script:
 * Run: bun run example/capped-window-change.integration.test.ts
