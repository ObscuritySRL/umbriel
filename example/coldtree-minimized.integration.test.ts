/**
 * coldtree-minimized — when a snapshot finds 0 actionable controls AND the window is MINIMIZED, the recovery note
 * must steer to manage_window {action:'restore'} (a UWP/WinUI window tears its UIA tree down while minimized, so
 * re-snapshotting alone won't repopulate it) — NOT the generic "re-snapshot / activate" note, which would loop.
 *
 * Pure-function assertions on coldTreeNote (deterministic), plus an opportunistic live check: minimize a WinUI app
 * (Calculator) and confirm that IF its tree reads empty, the snapshot carries the restore steer.
 *
 * bun test is broken repo-wide for FFI; runnable harness:
 * Run: bun run example/coldtree-minimized.integration.test.ts
