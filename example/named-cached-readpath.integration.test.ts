/**
 * named-cached-readpath — named() (the RESOLVED-control identity in a ref-action result, mcp.ts) read controlType + name
 * LIVE (get_CurrentControlType + get_CurrentName) — TWO cross-process round-trips per ref action — even though a ref-path
 * element comes from the snapshot's BuildUpdatedCache with Name + ControlType ALREADY cached (the very values the rendered
 * tree is built from). named() now reads cachedControlTypeName / cachedName on the ref path, with a cachedControlType===0
 * guard that falls back to the live read for a find()-resolved element (which has no cache). This proves the two cached
 * reads equal the live reads for ref elements, and that the fallback boundary (uncached → 0/"") is exact.
 *
 * Proof (live, library-level — the exact getters named() now uses): launch Calculator, snapshot; for every ref'd element
 * cachedControlTypeName===controlTypeName AND cachedName===name (byte-identical); the attached root (a find()-resolved
 * analog with no cache) reports cachedControlType===0 without throwing, so the live fallback fires exactly there.
 * Calculator closed in teardown.
 *
 * bun test is broken repo-wide — runnable harness:
 * Run: bun run example/named-cached-readpath.integration.test.ts
